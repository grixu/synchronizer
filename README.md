# Synchronizer

Engine for sync data between two systems (eg. Comarch CDN XL and some custom Laravel app or API). This package allows to exclude some fields from synchronization but still, you can get data from excluded fields if local field is empty. There is logging of changes to database - so you can easily check what was changed and on which fields. 

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require grixu/synchronizer
```

## Usage

```php
// You can use facade as well
use Grixu\Synchronizer\Synchronizer;

// eg. for local model is in $lanaguage, and foreignData is in DTO $languageData
$map = [
    'name' => 'name',
    'updated_at' => 'updatedAt'
];
$synchronizer = new Synchronizer($map, $language, $languageData);
$synchronizer->sync();
```

### Configuration

There are 3 options available in config file to adjust how `synchronizer` should work and behave:
```php
return [
    'send_slack_sum_up' => env('SYNCHRONIZER_SLACK_SUM_UP', true),
    'db_logging' => env('SYNCHRONIZER_DB_LOGGING',true),
    'log_turned_off_fields' => [
        'updated_at'
    ]
];
```

Option `send_slack_sum_up` should be used to block sending daily sum ups to Slack channel. You could still use Slack notifications in your app, but simply turn off notifications from this package.

`db_logging` flag designed to switch on/off logging changes in local model to database.

 In `log_turned_off_fields` array you could define names of fields used as timestamp - which should not be logged as change in local model.

### Artisan commands

We have 4 available commands:
- `synchronizer:add` - used to add new excluded field at specified model
- `synchronizer:list` - to list and delete excluded fields
- `synchronizer:send` - for sending daily sum ups about amounts of changes in models
- `synchronizer:set` - to set timestamp (beginning) for daily sum ups. This command should be used after cache purge. Due to last sum ups send timestamp located in a cache. 

### Testing

``` bash
composer test
```
